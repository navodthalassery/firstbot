[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metronical/proto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metronical/proto)

Functions for extending JavaScript native type (written in TypeScript). This code is being extracted from the [Metron](https://github.com/metronical/metron) framework so it can be used in different projects without requiring the full framework.
